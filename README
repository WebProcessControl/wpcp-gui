Install dependecies with:
  bower install

Start a webserver in the directory:
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Open index.html in browser!
You will be asked for the endpoint of the WPCP server:
  e.g. ws://127.0.0.1:7681/

You can append the WPCP server also after a hash in the url:
  e.g. /path/to/index.html#ws://127.0.0.1:7681/

Have FUN!!
